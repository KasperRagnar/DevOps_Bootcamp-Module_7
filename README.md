#### This project is for the Devops bootcamp exercise for 
#### "Containers - Docker" 

## Note from student:
### All of my application `environment variables` and `credentials` are set inside a `docker-compose.yaml` file that has been added to the `.gitignore` file list


# How to set your environment variables: 
Remember to add your own values after the '=' symbol on each line

## In the Windows CMD
---------------------------------------------
```
set DB_USER=
set DB_PWD=
set DB_ROOT_PWD=
set DB_SERVER=
set DB_NAME=
set PRIVATE_REPO_ADDRESS=
```

## In the Linux or Mac Terminal
```
export DB_USER=
export DB_PWD=
export DB_ROOT_PWD=
export DB_SERVER=
export DB_NAME=
export PRIVATE_REPO_ADDRESS=
```
