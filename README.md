#### This project is for the Devops bootcamp exercise for 
#### "Containers - Docker" 

## Note from student:
### All of my application `environment variables` and `credentials` are set inside a `docker-compose.yaml` file that has been added to the `.gitignore` file list


# How to set your environment variables: 
Remember to add your own values after the '=' symbol on each line

**NOTE:** 
Windows uses the `set` command for setting environment variables,  
Linux and Mac uses the `export` command. 
You will need to update the bellow lines depending on your system of choice.
